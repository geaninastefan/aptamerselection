# aptamerselection

Aptamers have come in the spotlight as bio-mimetic molecular recognition elements in the field of biomedicine due to various applications in diagnostics, drug delivery, therapeutics, and pharmaceutical analysis. Aptamers are composed of nucleic acid strands (DNA or RNA) that can specifically interact in a three-dimensional tailored design with the target molecule.

The goal is to help scientists in selecting the best aptamer for their application.
